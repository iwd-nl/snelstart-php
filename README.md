# Snelstart B2B API

PHP client library to use the Snelstart B2B API.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/iwd-nl/snelstart-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/iwd-nl/snelstart-php)

__Note that this library is not created, or maintained, by Snelstart.__

# Pre-word
This release will support only version 2. Version 1 is deprecated and is removed from this project, as Snelstart does not actively promote it anymore. Instructions on how to upgrade will be added when the next release takes place.

# Installation
Installation is easy as 1, 2, 3 thanks to Composer.
```bash
composer require iwd-nl/snelstart-php
```

# Usage
Create an account at [https://b2bapi-developer.snelstart.nl/] and subscribe to 'Verkenning'. Obtain the Primary and Secondary key from your Profile and generate a key on the web interface of Snelstart under 'Maatwerk'. You are going to need these credentials for the next chapter.

## Authentication
Now that you have obtained the credentials you can start by connection the library to the API.
```php
$primaryKey = "<primary>";
$secondaryKey = "<secondary>";
$clientKey = "<maatwerksleutel>";

$bearerToken = new \SnelstartPHP\Secure\BearerToken\ClientKeyBearerToken($clientKey);
$accessTokenConnection = new \SnelstartPHP\Secure\AccessTokenConnection($bearerToken);
$accessToken = $accessTokenConnection->getToken();

$connection = new \SnelstartPHP\Secure\V2Connector(
    new \SnelstartPHP\Secure\ApiSubscriptionKey($primaryKey, $secondaryKey),
    $accessToken
);
```

_Please note that there is also a class named `SnelstartPHP\Secure\CachedAccessTokenConnection` for when you are done with developing. This will automatically take care of renewing expired access tokens. _

### Check if you are really authenticated
We implemented the `EchoConnector` to test to see if you are authenticated.
